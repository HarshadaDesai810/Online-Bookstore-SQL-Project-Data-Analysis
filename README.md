# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project – Skillcourse by Satish Dhawale

This project is a part of the SQL Learning Series provided by Satish Dhawale([https://www.youtube.com/@SatishDhawale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxgAb6FGTBE&t=5544s)) through Skillcourse on YouTube. It helped me apply real-world SQL concepts using a structured dataset of an online bookstore.

## 📦 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed an online bookstore's database containing information about books, customers, and orders. I used PostgreSQL to write SQL queries that answered both basic and advanced business questions.

### ✅ Key Skills Used:
- Database design and schema creation
- Importing CSV files using `COPY`
- SQL joins and filtering
- Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Grouping, ordering, and limiting results
- Real-world insights and analytics
